          <h4>Soil</h4>
          <p>
            The potato can be grown almost on any type of soil except saline and alkaline soils. Soils, which are naturally loose, offer least resistance to the enlargement of the tubers is preferred. Loamy and sandy loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration are most suitable for cultivation of potato crop. The soil with pH range of 5.2-6.4 is considered to be ideal.

          <h4>Climate</h4>
          <p>
            Potato is a temperate climate crop, however it grows under a diverse range of climatic conditions. It is grown only under such conditions where the temperature during the growing seasons is moderately cool. The vegetative growth of the plant is best at a temperature of 24°C while tuber development is favoured at 20°C. Hence, potato is grown as a summer crop in the hills and as a winter crop in the tropical and subtropical regions. The crop can be raised up to an altitude of 3000 m above the sea level

            <h4>Intercultivation</h4>
            <h6>Weed Control</h6>
            <p>
                The potato crop develops canopy in about 4 weeks after planting and weeds must be controlled by this time to gain competitive advantage for the crop.
            </p>
            <h6>Earthing up</h6>
            <p>
                The main object of earthing up is to keep the soil loose and destroy weeds. Two or three earthing up should be done at an interval of 15-20 days.
            </p>
            <h6>Corp Roatation</h6>
            <p>The cropping sequence recommended is as follows.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bihar : Potato-Mung- Paddy; Potato-Mung-Groundnut</li>
                <li>Punjab : Potato-Wheat-Maize ; Potato-Wheat-Paddy ; Potato-Wheat-Green manure crop</li>
                <li>Assam : Potato-Mung-Paddy (Transplanted)</li>
